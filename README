  This is a handy little utility to display a tree view of directories that
I wrote some time ago and just added color support to.  I've decided that
since no one else has done something simular I would go ahead and release
it, even though it's barely a 1st year CS student hack.  I've found it damn
handy to peruse a directory tree though, especially when someone is trying to
hide something from you.

  The main distribution site for tree is here:

  ftp://mama.indstate.edu/linux/tree/

  If you don't like the way it looks let me know how you think it should be
formatted. Free free to use and abuse and do with as you please.  Also feel
free to suggest modifications and additions.

  Thanks go out so the following people who have helped bring tree to the
pinnacle of perfection that it is: ;)

Francesc Rocher
  - Added HTML output (-H).
  - Added options -o, -L and -R.

Gerald Scheidl
  - Added -S option to print ASCII graphics lines for use under linux
    console when an alternate console font has been selected (might also
    work under DOS telnet).

Guido Socher (and others)
  - Made tree more portable.  Should compile under solaris.

Mitja Lacen
  - Discovered bug where tree will segmentation fault on long pathnames.
  - Discovered in -L argument processing.

And many others whom I've failed to keep track of.  I should have started
this list years ago.
