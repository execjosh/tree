  This is a handy little utility to display a tree view of directories that
I wrote some time ago and just added color support to.  I've decided that
since no one else has done something simular I would go ahead and release
it, even though it's barely a 1st year CS student hack.  I've found it damn
handy to peruse a directory tree though, specially when someone is trying to
hide something from you.

  If you don't like the way it looks let me know how you think it should be
formatted.

  As always, feel free to use and abuse this peice of fluff.  Feel free to
suggest modifications to it, but I'm not going to take criticisms on this
one, since quite frankly, if you can't code something like this yourself,
what the hell are you complaining about?
