  Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions, particularly if
you are installing on a non-Linux machine.

  This is a handy little utility to display a tree view of directories that
I wrote some time ago and just added color support to.  I've decided that
since no one else has done something similar I would go ahead and release
it, even though it's barely a 1st year CS student hack.  I've found it damn
handy to peruse a directory tree though, especially when someone is trying to
hide something from you.

  The main distribution site for tree is here:

  http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/
  ftp://mama.indstate.edu/linux/tree/

  If you don't like the way it looks let me know how you think it should be
formatted. Feel free to suggest modifications and additions.

pinnacle of perfection that it is: ;)

    console when an alternate console font has been selected (might also
    work under DOS telnet).
