Installation instructions:

1. Edit the Makefile for your OS.  Comment out the Linux options and uncomment
   the options for your OS.
2. Type: make
3. Type: make install
4. Enjoy colorful directory trees.

  I cannot test on non-Linux machines, so please feel free to contribute
porting information, bug reports, compile options, patches, etc for porting to
other OS's to ice@mama.indstate.edu.

  I would also welcome any localization efforts, particularly translating the
man page to other languages.  And of course feel free to suggest options and
improvements you would like to see in tree.
