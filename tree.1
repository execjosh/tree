.TH TREE 1 "\*(V)" "UNIX Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
tree \- list contents of directories in a tree-like format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtree\fP [ \fB-adflpsFiCnAx\fP ] [ \fB-P \fI pattern\fP ] [ \fIdirectory\fP ... ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fITree\fP is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth
indented listing of files, which is colorized ala \fIdircolors\fP if the \fBLS_COLORS\fP
environment variable is set and output is to tty.  With no arguments,
\fItree\fP lists the files in the current directory.  When directory
arguments are given, \fItree\fP lists all the files and/or directories found
in the given directories each in turn.  Upon completion of listing all
files/directories found, \fItree\fP returns the total number of files and/or
directories listed.

By default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the symbolic
link refers to is printed after the name of the link in the format:
.br

    name -> real-path
.br

If the `\fB-l\fP' option is given and the symbolic link refers to an actual
directory, then \fItree\fP will follow the path of the symbolic link as if
it were a real directory.
.br

.SH OPTIONS
\fITree\fP understands the following command line switches:

.TP
.B -a
All files are printed.  By default tree does not print hidden files (those
beginning with a dot `.').  In no event does tree print the file system
constructs `.' (current directory) and `..' (previous directory).
.PP
.TP
.B -d
List directories only.
.PP
.TP
.B -f
Prints the full path prefix for each file.
.PP
.TP
.B -i
Makes tree not print the indentation lines, useful when used in conjunction
with the \fB-f\fP option.
.PP
.TP
.B -l
Follows symbolic links if they point to directories, as if they were directories.
.PP
.TP
.B -x
Stay on the current file-system only.  Ala \fBfind \fI-xdev\fP.
.PP
.TP
\fB-P \fIpattern\fP
List only those files that match the wild-card \fIpattern\fP.  Note: you must use
the \fI-a\fP option to also consider those files beginning with a dot `.' for
matching.
.TP
.B -p
Print the protections for each file (as per ls -l).
.PP
.TP
.B -s
Print the size of each file along with the name.
.PP
.TP
.B -F
Append a `/' for directories, a `=' for socket files and a `*' for
executable files as per ls -F
.PP
.TP
.B -n
Turn colorization off always, over-ridden by the \fB-C\fP option.
.PP
.TP
.B -C
Turn colorization on always, unless the LS_COLORS environment variable
is not set.  Useful to colorize output to a pipe.
.PP
.TP
.B -A
Turn on ANSI line graphics hack when printing the indentation lines.
.PP
.br
.SH FILES
/etc/DIR_COLORS		System color database.
.br
~/.dircolors			Users color database.
.br

.SH ENVIRONMENT
\fBLS_COLORS\fP		Color information created by dircolors
