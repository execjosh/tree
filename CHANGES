Version 1.2
  - Added -D to print the date of the last modification.
  - Added -t option to sort by last modification time (ala ls -t).
  - Added -I <pattern>, simular to the -P option except tree does not print
    those files which match the pattern.
  - Made tree print non-printable characters in filenames in standard unix
    carrot notation.
  - Added -N option to make tree print filenames without any processing.
  - Added -q option to make tree print non-printable characters in filenames
    as question marks.
  - Added `|' to -F output and made it only print character type after the
    link on sym-links, not on the symlink name itself.
  - Added -u option to display username/uid, and -g option to display group
    name/gid.
  - Fully (pass the salt) implemented dircolors support.

Version 1.1
  - Made some changes to the Makefile to insure proper installation and for
    multi-architecture support and a bug-fix.
  - Made root directory colorized if dircolors is enabled.
  - Put []'s around permission and size info, 'cause I think it looks better.
  - Added -A option to enable ANSI-lines hack.
  - Added some sanity checks for dircolors support.
  - Added -P <pattern> to list only those files that match the wildcard
    given in <pattern>.
  - Fixed error where relative symbolic links to directories would not be
    followed when the -l option was used.
  - Made uid 0 the same as anyone else (-a was default for uid 0)
  - Added -x directive to stay on one filesystem (ala find -xdev).

Version 1.0
  - The original, a model of perfection...
