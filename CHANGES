Version 1.6.0
  - Re-org of code into multiple files, split HTML and Unix listdir() into
    separate functions, various code cleanups and optimizations.
  - Fixed a memory leak in listdir() when memory was allocated early and not
    freed before function exit.
  - Fixed possible buffer overflow where symbolic links are followed.
  - Fixed links printing "argetm" before the name of the link when the LINK
    setting for DIR_COLORS is set to target (Markus Schnalke
    <meillo@marmaro.de>)
  - More fully support dir colors -- added support for su, sg, tw, ow, & st
    options (and "do" in theory).
  - Use the environment variable "TREE_COLORS" instead of "LS_COLORS" for
    color information if it exists.
  - Added --si flag to print filesizes in SI (powers of 1000) units (Ulrich
    Eckhardt)
  - Added -Q to quote filenames in double quotes.  Does not override -N or -q.
  - Control characters are no longer printed in carrot notation, but as
    backslashed octal, ala ls, except for codes 7-13 which are printed as
    \a, \b, \t, \n, \v, \f and \r respectively. Spaces and backslashes are
    also now backslashed as per ls, for better input to scripts unless -Q
    is in use (where "'s are backslashed.) (Ujjwal Kumar)
  - Added -U for unsorted listings (directory order).
  - Added -c for sorting by last status change (ala ls -c).
  - --dirsfirst is now a meta-sort and does not override -c, -v, -r or -t, but
    is disabled by -U.
  - After many requests, added the ability to process the entire tree before
    emitting output.  Used for the new options --du, which works like the du
    command: sums the amount of space under each directory and prints a total
    amount used in the report and the --prune option which will prune all empty
    directories from the output (makes the -P option output much more readable.)
    It should be noted that this will be slow to output when processing large
    directory trees and can consume copious amounts of memory, use at your own
    peril.
  - Added -X option to emit the directory tree in XML format (turns colorization
    off always.)
  - Added --timefmt option to specify the format of time display (implies -D).
    Uses the strftime format.

Version 1.5.3
  - Properly quote directories for the system command when tree is relaunched
    using the -R option.
  - Fixed possible indentation problem if dirs[*] is not properly zeroed
    (Martin Nagy).
  - Use strcoll() instead of strcmp() to sort files based on locale if set.
  - Change "const static" to "static const" to remove some compiler warnings
    for Solaris (Kamaraju Kusumanchi).
  - Actually use TREE_CHARSET if it's defined.
  - Automatically select UTF-8 charset if TREE_CHARSET is not set, and the
    locale is set to *UTF-8 (overridden with --charset option.)

Version 1.5.2.2
  - Set locale before checking MB_CUR_MAX.
  - Added HP-NonStop platform support (Craig McDaniel <craigmcd@gmail.com>)
  - Fixed to support 32 bit UID/GIDs.
  - Added Solaris build options to Makefile (edit and uncomment to use).

Version 1.5.2.1
  - Added strverscmp.c file for os's without strverscmp.  Source file is
    attributed to: Jean-Franois Bignolles <bignolle@ecoledoc.ibp.fr>
  - Try different approach to MB_CUR_MAX problem.
  - Changed the argument to printit() to be signed char to avoid warnings.

Version 1.5.2
  - Added --filelimit X option to not descend directories that have more than
    X number of files in them.
  - Added -v option for version sorting (also called natural sorting) ala ls.

Version 1.5.1.2
  - Fixed compile issues related to MB_CUR_MAX on non-linux machines.
  - Removed unecessary features.h

Version 1.5.1.1
  - Regression in HTML output, fixed formatting issues.

Version 1.5.1
  - Remove extraneous / at end of user input directory names when using -f
    option (Zurd)
  - List available charsets if --charset option is missing charset argument.
  - Fixed --charset option processing bug.
  - Fixed missing <br>'s when -i option used with -H.
  - Added -h option for human readable output.
  - Colorization bugfix for special files and directories (make tree behave as
    ls does)

Version 1.5.0
  - Added -T option to change title and H1 header in HTML output.
  - Added -r option to reverse alpha sort output, ala. 'ls -r'.
  - '|' wildcard support added by David MacMahon <davidm@astron.Berkeley.EDU>.
  - Remove extraneous '/' at the end of dirs and dir-symlinks in HTML output.
  - Removed several possible overflow problems by dynamically allocating
    arrays in several places.
  - Better support for Locales and printing utf-8 encoded characters in
    filenames (still hackish).
  - Fixed -t to alphasort files with same time-stamps.
  - Fixed encoding of filenames in HTML output, Kyosuke and others.
  - Patches by Kyosuke Tokoro <NBG01720@nifty.ne.jp>:
    - Now, runs OS/2 systems.
      + Print the file attributes in 'adhrs' format for each file, instead
        of the protections in 'drwxrwxrwx' format, when running the tree
        on OS/2 with option -p.
    - Added --charset option, to specify which character set is used for
      output.
       + You can specify any IANA registered character set name. But I have
         tested only following character sets:
               Shift_JIS       EUC-JP          IBM850
               UTF-8           ISO-8859-1      US-ASCII
       + Now, `-S' option is equal to `--charset=IBM437'.
       + When running on OS/2 systems, the default value of this option
         is according to current codepage.  On the other systems, no default.

    carrot notation.
  - Added -N option to make tree print filenames without any processing.
  - Added -q option to make tree print non-printable characters in filenames
    as question marks.
