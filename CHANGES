Version 1.1
  - Made some changes to the Makefile to insure proper installation and for
    multi-architecture support and a bug-fix.
  - Made root directory colorized if dircolors is enabled.
  - Put []'s around permission and size info, 'cause I think it looks better.
  - Added -A option to enable ANSI-lines hack.
  - Added some sanity checks for dircolors support.
  - Added -P <pattern> to list only those files that match the wildcard
    given in <pattern>.
  - Fixed error where relative symbolic links to directories would not be
    followed when the -l option was used.
  - Made uid 0 the same as anyone else (-a was default for uid 0)
  - Added -x directive to stay on one filesystem (ala find -xdev).

Version 1.0
  - The original, a model of perfection...
